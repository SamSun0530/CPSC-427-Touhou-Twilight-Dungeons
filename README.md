# Team-01-Touhou-Twilight-Dungeons

## Background Story

This game takes place in Gensokyo, a place secluded from Japan by a magical barrier and is home to various life forms such as fairies, and gods. One day when Reimu, a shrine maiden, continues her routine to fetch water at a nearby well at her shrine when she discovers that after reeling up the bucket, it wasnâ€™t full of water as usual! Many thoughts came rushing into her mind, what could be the cause of this? To find the cause of this situation she decided to slip down into the well. Then she saw a faint light wiggling at the bottom of the tunnel, it seemed there was a bigger area for her to explore. She found a dungeon! With this great discovery, her main motivation for water shifted. Her eyes sparkled, who put this dungeon here?

(Note: In Gensokyo, all conflicts are resolved by Danmaku, which means "barrage" and another name for bullet hell, thus, this is why everyone can shoot bullets)
