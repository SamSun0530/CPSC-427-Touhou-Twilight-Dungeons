Flandre: (shock) Oh? A visitor? It's been so long since\n anyone has found their way here. And it's Reimu, \nthe shrine maiden! How exciting!
Reimu: (angry) Flandre Scarlet... I should have known.\n The surge of chaotic energy leading here...\n it was your doing.
Flandre: (laugh) Chaos? Oh, I was just playing with my power.\n It gets so boring being cooped up all the time. \nYou understand, don't you?
Reimu: (angry) I understand that your 'play' could endanger Gensokyo.\n Your idea of fun can't come at the expense of others' safety.\n I'm here to make sure of that.
Flandre: (laugh) But that's what makes it so fun! \nThe thrill of the unknown! Don't you ever crave \na little chaos in your oh-so-orderly life, Reimu?
Reimu: (normal) There's a difference between seeking adventure\n and recklessly endangering lives. It ends now, \nFlandre. I won't let you cause any more trouble.
Flandre: (special) Trouble? No, no, no. I'm offering excitement!\n But if you insist on spoiling my fun... Let's make this\n interesting, shall we? 
Flandre: (special) Show me the extent of your resolve, Reimu!
