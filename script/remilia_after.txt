Reimu: (normal) It¡¯s over, Remilia. Let¡¯s go home.\n Gensokyo needs healing, and so do you.
Remilia: (normal) You are truly formidable, Reimu.\n I underestimated not just your strength but your resolve.\n Perhaps... perhaps I was mistaken.
Reimu: (laugh) Everyone makes mistakes, Remilia.\n What matters is recognizing them and trying to make things right.\n You still have a chance to change things.
Remilia: (laugh) Change... Yes, maybe that¡¯s still possible.\n I wanted to create a perfect world,\n but perhaps the world¡¯s imperfections are what make it worth protecting.
Reimu: (laugh) Exactly. Let¡¯s protect it together, Remilia,\n not just as shrine maiden and vampire, but as part of Gensokyo.
Remilia: (normal) I would like that. Thank you, Reimu, for stopping me...\n and for saving me from myself.
Reimu: (normal) Come on, let¡¯s head back.\n There are many who will want to see you,\n to help you and understand your dreams, the right way this time.
