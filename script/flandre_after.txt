Reimu: (normal) It's over, Flandre.
Flandre: (cry) You're really strong, Reimu.\n Stronger than I thought.
Reimu: (normal) It wasn't about strength, Flandre.\n It's about understanding the balance. Your power is immense,\n and with it comes responsibility.
Flandre: (cry) Responsibility... I never thought about it like that.\n I just wanted to... to have some fun.\n But, I see now. My fun caused trouble.
Reimu: (normal) We all seek fun, Flandre. It's human nature.\n But your actions have consequences. There are safer ways\n to find excitement, ways that don't put others at risk.
Flandre: (cry) I... I want to learn those ways. Reimu, can you...\n Can you show me? How to be strong and responsible?
Reimu: (laugh) Of course, Flandre.\n But only if you promise to use your power wisely\n and think of others.
Flandre: (laugh) I promise, Reimu. \nAnd thank you... for understanding \n Let's put out the fire together.
Reimu: (normal) That's the spirit. \nBut our work isn't done yet. 
Reimu: (normal) Flandre, your sister's actions are driven by fear, \nand it's leading her to make choices that \ncould endanger us all.
Flandre: (shock) Remilia... is that scared? \nI never realized.
Reimu: (normal) Yes, and it's our duty to help her see beyond her fears.\nThe power she wields can either be \na force for creation or destruction.
Reimu: (normal) We must guide her towards the light, \nnot let her linger in the shadow of her doubts.
Flandre: (resolved) I understand now. \nIt's not just about stopping her, \nit's about saving her... and everyone else.
Reimu: (normal) Exactly. \nNow, let's go find Sakuya. \nShe'll know where Remilia is planning her final move. 
Flandre: (hopeful) Let's do it, Reimu.
