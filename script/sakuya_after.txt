Reimu: (normal) Sakuya, you fought well. I didn¡¯t want this.\n But you know I can¡¯t let Remilia go through with her plan.
Sakuya: (normal) I understand, Reimu. Your strength and resolve...\n they are indeed greater than I anticipated.\n I see now that you truly wish to save Lady Remilia, not harm her.
Reimu: (normal) Thank you, Sakuya.\n Now, please, tell me where she is.
Sakuya: (laugh) Lady Remilia has taken refuge in the sky islands.\n She believes she can start anew there, away from any opponents.\n You will find her there, amid the clouds.
Reimu: (shock) Sky islands... That won¡¯t be easy to reach.\n But I must go, no matter the challenge.\n Will you help me, Sakuya?
Sakuya: (normal) I will provide you with the means to reach her.\n It is the least I can do after your show of dedication.\n Please, Reimu, save Lady Remilia from herself.
Reimu: (normal) I promise, Sakuya.\n I will bring her back, safely.
