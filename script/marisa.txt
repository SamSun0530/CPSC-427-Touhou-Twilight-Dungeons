Marisa: (shock) Well, well, if it ain't Reimu!\n What brings you to my humble shop\n in the depths of this dark dungeon, huh?
Reimu: (laugh) Marisa, what are you doing down here?\n Selling buffs in a dungeon?\n That¡¯s a new venture even for you.
Marisa: (laugh) Ya know me, always lookin'\n for new opportunities! And what better place\n than right here where all the action is?
Marisa: (normal) So, what'll it be today?\n A little boost to help you out?
Reimu: (special) I suppose I could use something to strengthen myself.\n What do you have?
Marisa: (special) For you, Reimu?\n Let¡¯s make it a special deal.\n Come around and see what we have!
