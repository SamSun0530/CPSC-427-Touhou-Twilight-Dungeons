Reimu: (normal) It's over, Cirno. Do you see now?\n Your actions have repercussions. People depend on that water.
Cirno: (cry) I didn't realize I was causing so much trouble...\n I just wanted to be stronger.
Reimu: (normal) It¡¯s good to improve, but you must think\n about when and where.\n You¡¯ve affected everyone in Gensokyo.
Cirno: (cry) I¡¯m sorry, Reimu.\n I¡¯ll be more careful next time.
Reimu: (normal) Apology accepted. Just be mindful of others.\n Now, let¡¯s get the well back to normal.
Cirno: (normal) Oh yes definitely, also,\n do you know Flandre has been setting fires around the grasslands?\n It¡¯s getting out of control.
Reimu: (shock) Fires? That's bad!\n Let's get back the surface and stop her!
