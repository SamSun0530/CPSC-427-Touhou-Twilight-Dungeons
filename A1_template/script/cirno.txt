Cirno: (laugh) Ahaha! What's a human like you doing here?\n This is a secret training ground I found!
Reimu: (angry) So it was you,\n Cirno. I should have known from this cold.\n Your 'training ground' is in the way of my shrine.
Reimu: (angry) You need to stop this at once.
Cirno: (special) Hmph! I, strongest fairy Cirno,\n will not be stopped so easily! If you want me to stop, \nthen you'll have to beat me in battle!
Cirno: (normal) Get ready, Reimu, because I won't hold back!
Reimu: (normal) I was hoping you'd see reason, but it looks like \nwe'll have to do this the hard way. Prepare yourself, Cirno.
