Cirno: (laugh) Ahaha! What's a human like you doing here?\n This is my secret training ground, \nwhere I become the strongest!
Reimu: (angry) So it was you,\n Cirno. I should have known from this cold.\n Your 'training ground' has caused quite a problem.
Reimu: (angry) The well at the shrine is frozen,\n leaving us without water.\n You need to stop this at once.
Cirno: (special) Hmph! I, the great and powerful Cirno,\n will not be stopped so easily! If you want me to stop, \nthen you'll have to beat me in battle!
Cirno: (laugh) Get ready, Reimu, because I won't hold back!
Reimu: (angry) I was hoping you'd see reason, but it looks like \nwe'll have to do this the hard way. Prepare yourself, Cirno.\n I'll cool down your hot-headed plans and restore peace to Gensokyo!
