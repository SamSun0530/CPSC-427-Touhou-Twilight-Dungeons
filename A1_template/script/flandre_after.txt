Reimu: (normal) It's over, Flandre. You're not hurt, are you?
Flandre: (cry) No... I'm not hurt. You're really strong, Reimu.\n Stronger than I thought.
Reimu: (normal) It wasn't about strength, Flandre.\n It's about understanding the balance. Your power is immense,\n and with it comes responsibility.
Flandre: (cry) Responsibility... I never thought about it like that.\n I just wanted to... to have some fun.\n But, I see now. My fun caused trouble.
Reimu: (normal) We all seek fun, Flandre. It's human nature.\n But your actions have consequences. There are safer ways\n to find excitement, ways that don't put others at risk.
Flandre: (cry) I... I want to learn those ways. Reimu, can you...\n Can you show me? How to be strong and responsible?
Reimu: (laugh) Of course, Flandre.\n But only if you promise to use your power wisely\n and think of others.
Flandre: (laugh) I promise, Reimu. \nAnd thank you... for understanding.
