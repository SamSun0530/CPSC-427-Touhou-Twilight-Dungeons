Reimu: (normal) Remilia, this has to stop.\n I've come to bring you back before you do something you can't undo.
Remilia: (normal) Reimu, my dear shrine maiden, always so resolute.\n But you see, I am creating a new world here,\n above the petty squabbles of the earth.
Remilia: (normal) Why can't you see the beauty of my vision?
Reimu: (angry) Your 'new world' is built on destruction and fear!\n You're threatening the very fabric of Gensokyo.\n This isn't the way.
Remilia: (normal) My intentions are misunderstood, Reimu.\n I seek liberation, not oppression.
Remilia: (normal) But for those who cannot see this vision,\n I suppose I must be the villain they believe me to be.
Reimu: (normal) It doesn't have to be this way, Remilia.\n You can choose to stop this madness. Come back with me.\n Let's find another way to achieve your dreams.
Remilia: (normal) Ah, Reimu. If only it were that simple.\n I've gone too far to turn back now.
Remilia: (normal) If you believe you can stop me,\n then show me the strength of your conviction.
Reimu: (normal) I didn't want it to end like this,\n but I can't let you destroy everything we hold dear.\n If a battle is the only way to reach you, then I'm prepared to fight.
